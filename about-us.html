           <h1 style="margin-top:0"> Maria & En Tao</h1><p>
With a background in IT, En Tao was itching to use his creative brain. He worked for a while in commercial photography and IT network administration and found that he enjoyed the technical and artistic aspects of photography. He started to delve more seriously into his photo hobby, and eventually decided to turn this passion into his vocation.</p><p>

Maria, on the other hand, has a passion for connecting with individuals across cultures and creative projects. She traveled the world, studied multiple languages, and found that she had a knack for bringing out people’s brightest personalities behind the camera lens. It was only natural that she would end up as a professional photographer.</p><p>

Maria and En Tao met in the light of a campfire in their college years, after Maria returned from a year in China. They instantly connected as friends because of their multicultural backgrounds and love for culinary experimentation. He helped her with her Mandarin lessons, she taught him to ballroom dance. Together, they took lots and lots of pictures.</p><p>

Their decision to launch Magnified Joy Photography came from a terrible photography experience at their own wedding. They thought they were doing the right thing by saving money and hiring an inexperienced photographer. As a result, both the service from their vendor and the resulting photos were very disappointing. Compromising on photography became the biggest regret of their wedding and they walked away thinking “we could have shot our wedding better ourselves.”
</p><p>
So they set out to give other couples a better experience. And Magnified Joy Photography was born.</p>

<p>We are not your average wedding photographers. We are a traveling husband and wife team that care as much about your marriage as the quality of your photography experience on your wedding day.</p>

<p>We take an organic approach to wedding and engagement photography. We take the initiative to make sure your day will flow as smoothly as possible with ongoing communication throughout your engagement as well as getting together to plan and discuss your wedding day timeline several weeks before your wedding. When your wedding day arrives, you will feel confident about our approach, as we naturally and sincerely interact with you and your guests. We take great joy in getting to build relationships with every one of our clients, and their families and friends, and consider it a huge privilege to be entrusted to photograph one of the greatest days of your lives. For us, Magnified Joy Photography is far more than just shooting a wedding. It’s an organic experience. It’s curated quality artisan products. But most of all, it’s relationships.</p>

<h2>A Traveling Team</h2><p>
As a husband and wife team, we love working with couples, and we have extensive experience working in multicultural settings and with multi-racial couples – after all, we are one! We have shot several multicultural weddings. We have even done an international wedding in Hong Kong for a French bride and a Chinese groom, with a non-English ceremony.</p><p>

We don’t have one set home base. And yes, we travel anywhere! We have done weddings across the United States, in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Colorado, California, and even as far as China. Wherever you are in the world, we can come to you! Our rates include travel to your wedding anywhere in the US so there will be no extra expenses for you, and we can create a custom quote for weddings abroad.</p>
