title: How do we book and pay?
---
A $1,500 retainer is due when you return the signed contract back to us. Your date is not secured until we have received a retainer and a signed contract. We prefer checks, but a credit card option is also available. Please contact us for full details.

We also arrange a la carte packages for non-traditional weddings, shorter time frames, and international events. Contact us with your ideas and we will work with you to customize as you need.
