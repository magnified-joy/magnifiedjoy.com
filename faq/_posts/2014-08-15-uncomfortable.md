Never fear! That’s why we offer a complimentary engagement shoot. This helps us all get to know each other and help you two feel more comfortable in front of the camera. That way when we get to your wedding day, you’ll already connect with the camera, connect with each other in front of the camera, and connect with us. You aren’t jumping into awkward, posed photos. We can become an extension of your friends and family who are celebrating along with you.
