<p>We would love to hear from you! Do not let distance deter you from considering us. All of our wedding packages include travel in the US. It does not matter if itâ€™s Florida or Alaska or anywhere in between, the price is the same! For international and destination weddings, please contact us and we can create a custom package for you. Please include as many details as possible about your day as this will help us streamline our communication.</p>

<p>Contact us for full pricing and for case-by-case situations such as elopements, destination weddings, boudoir and portraits.</p>

<p>
We look forward to grabbing coffee or tea with you and meeting you soon (in person or virtually via Skype or Facetime) to discuss how Magnified Joy can be apart of your wedding story.</p>

<p>With Joy,<br>
En Tao and Maria Ko<br>
