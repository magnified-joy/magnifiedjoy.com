<h2 class="center"><em>Our work goes beyond weddings and engagements.</em><br><br></h2>

<p><em>We work with small-scale artisans and craftsmen to offer beautiful touches to your photo experience.</em></p><p>
For example, the <strong>MJP keepsake box</strong> is hand crafted by our friend and past groom, talented woodcraftsman <a href="http://www.gundersonfurnishings.com/">Adam Gunderson</a>, made with sustainably harvested wood and engraved with our logo. It is perfect for your engagement, boudoir, and wedding images, as well as love notes, jewelry and other keepsakes

<p><em>Your wedding supports a good cause.</em></p>
<p>MJP supports <a href="http://www.weddingsforfreedom.com/weddings_for_freedom/home.html">Weddings for Freedom</a> to fight back against modern day slavery. Along with wedding vendors across the country, we annually donate a portion of our proceeds towards rescuing girls and boys from slavery and providing them with a safe haven and resources. A portion of the proceeds from YOUR wedding goes toward supporting this critical cause and has effects wider than we can imagine.</p>

<p><em>We have a unique Boudoir Line - a perfect gift for the love of your life!</em></p>
