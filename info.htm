           <h1 style="margin-top:0"> Maria & En Tao</h1><p>
With a background in IT, En Tao was itching to use his creative brain. He worked for a while in commercial photography and IT network administration and found that he enjoyed the technical and artistic aspects of photography. He started to delve more seriously into his photo hobby, and eventually decided to turn this passion into his vocation.</p><p>

Maria, on the other hand, has a passion for connecting with individuals across cultures and creative projects. She traveled the world, studied multiple languages, and found that she had a knack for bringing out people’s brightest personalities behind the camera lens. It was only natural that she would end up as a professional photographer.</p><p>

Maria and En Tao met in the light of a campfire in their college years, after Maria returned from a year in China. They instantly connected as friends because of their multicultural backgrounds and love for culinary experimentation. He helped her with her Mandarin lessons, she taught him to ballroom dance. Together, they took lots and lots of pictures.</p><p>

Their decision to launch Magnified Joy Photography came from a terrible photography experience at their own wedding. They thought they were doing the right thing by saving money and hiring an inexperienced photographer. As a result, both the service from their vendor and the resulting photos were very disappointing. Compromising on photography became the biggest regret of their wedding and they walked away thinking “we could have shot our wedding better ourselves.”
</p><p>
So they set out to give other couples a better experience. And Magnified Joy Photography was born.</p>
