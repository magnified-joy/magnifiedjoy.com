<p>Tiffany and I were roommates for a year and have become incredibly great friends, despite the oceans that separate us now. When we were roommates and fellow classmates learning Chinese together, we joked around that we were not interested in dating Chinese guys. Well, not only has that proven untrue once, but twice. We both ended up marrying Chinese guys--and both are much different than we had made up in our minds five years ago. Well, I could go on talking about my own husband, but let's focus on Tiffany and Tom here. </p>
<p>Tom is a Chinese native and an extremely talented oil painter, so much that he decided to pursue it through grad school. Tiffany, on the other hand, is from France and studied engineering, but in my opinion, is a master of fine French baking, Chinese culture, and language learning. Tiffany has foregone her mother tongue of French to commit to speaking her second and third languages, English and Chinese, with Tom. Pretty talented I'd say! Although Tiffany is one of the most independent women I know, Tom was able woo Stephanie into dating. It has been an incredible story as their interest in each other quickly turned to talking about marriage. We are so blessed to have developed a sweet friendship with Tom and Tiffany over the years and to have had the opportunity to return to Asia to shoot their engagement session as well. Enjoy a little bit of this Chinese + French love.</p>
