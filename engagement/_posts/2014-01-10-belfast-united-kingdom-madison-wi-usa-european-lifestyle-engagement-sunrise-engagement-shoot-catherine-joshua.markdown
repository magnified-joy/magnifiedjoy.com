<p>These two crazy lovebirds were reunited at last! My heart delighted for them as much as they were in delight with each other. You see, Cath, one of my best friends, and fellow UW-Madison Internationals Studies major, found her true love and life partner in Belfast, United Kingdom. Cath has something in her blood, like I do--a passion to travel around the world and dive into other cultures and languages. It is no surprise that she found her soon-to-be husband while living and studying peace + conflict resolution in Northern Ireland. </p>
<p>Joshua is English and Cath is American. Both were in Belfast studying abroad and met at a small house church, a tight-knit loving community of Christ-followers, known as <a href="http://www.villagebelfast.com/">Village</a>. In Cath's words, "About 20-30 people from all backgrounds (read: Protestants, Catholics, atheists, agnostics, "typical" Christians, etc) came together for services at my pastor's home. We also met during the week for a family-style meal and discussion. We discussed real life issues, theology, the Gospel, and the aches and pains and hilarities of life in Belfast. It wasn't unusual to head down to the pub with these pals and continue the conversations, or to get a coffee during the week to follow up with someone who needed a little extra support."</p>
<p>It was in this context that Joshua and Cath met and started dating. But with Cath's departure back to the U.S. this past summer, it left them dating long-distance for a while and heart-aches were deep and real. Both were eagerly longing to be together again. Joshua was awaiting his visit to Cath in her motherland in December, right after Cath's birthday and in time for the holidays. The day after Christmas, on Boxing Day (as they call it in the UK), Joshua made a simple proposal to Cath and put a beautiful sapphire ring on her finger (from <a href="http://mustardandpeaches.co.uk/blog/2014/1/2/sapphire-engagement-this-christmas">Mustard & Peaches</a>); so uniquely her. </p>
<p>Considering Joshua's short visit to the U.S., we were delighted that the timing of their engagement worked out wonderfully and we could set up an engagement shoot for them right away. A few days later, Cath brought Joshua to Madison, the sweet city that is our current home and also where Cath and I met and grew together as best friends. Joshua was already shocked by the tundra cold of Wisconsin, but he was a great sport as we went out for a sunrise photo shoot on Lake Monona. What a serenely beautiful morning as the sun rose above the horizon and created a warm glow on the snow! Cath + Joshua's style of playfulness and opposition to "posed" photos led us to a "lifestyle" shoot of playing outside and then making a quaint breakfast inside. From their interactions with them (and the photos to prove it!), it is evident that their propensity to laugh and play together will bring them many, many years of fun and exciting married life! </p>

<p>Some have captioned this one as "freestyle rap battle", "invisible partner bowling", or "ice dancing...the amateur league"! We think Joshua had the wittiest caption: "calming an invisible beached whale"!</p>
