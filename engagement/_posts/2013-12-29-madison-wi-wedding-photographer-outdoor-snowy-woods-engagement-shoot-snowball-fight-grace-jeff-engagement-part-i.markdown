<p>For the first part of their engagement shoot, they braved the cold and dug into the snow for a mini snowball fight. The powdery snow was not ideal for snowballs, but magical for their playful photo shoot. </p>

<p>What I admire about their love is that their fights end with hugs and warming up each others' hands. </p>

<p>Grace + Jeff whisper secrets to each other via their hands cupped over their mouths, rather than their ears, as Grace often did growing up as a child. They are just too cute, I can't handle it!</p>

<p>After a successful snowball fight outside, <a href="http://bit.ly/1cfmItT">Grace + Jeff made their way back inside for hot toddies, record-playing, romantic moments, and making art together</a>. </p>
