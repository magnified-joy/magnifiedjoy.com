<p>We are incredibly fortunate to get to know these two fantastic people, Stephanie and Stephen, since they moved to Madison in 2013. We found each other online and admired each others' work as a fellow husband and wife wedding photographer team. Not only do they also excel at their art, but they excel at building relationships. We have enjoyed several dinners together, conversing for hours about faith, our amazing clients, travels, and our business dreams.</p>
<p>After <a href="http://bit.ly/1cTMaCw">second-shooting a wedding with Stephen in Indiana</a> the previous day, we ventured with our spouses over to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/indu/index.htm">Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore</a> for a little beachside photo shoot. It was a mild late October day, but the winds really picked up along the dunes of Lake Michigan. Nonetheless, En Tao + I had a blast with Stephanie + Stephen as we played in the sand and captured their natural love for each other. Thank you Stephanie + Stephen for this spontaneous adventure--and <em>romantic</em>--photo shoot!</p>
