<p>Grace + Jeff wanted to do a more "lifestyle" session for their engagement shoot. <a href="http://bit.ly/1eODVi8">After a mini-snowball fight and romp in the snow around their neighborhood</a>, they came back to their home to warm up over some hot drinks and good music.</p>
<p>As Jeff turned on the stovetop for hot water, Grace found her hand-made painted ceramic mugs for them to share.<br />

<p>Jeff is known to be a little bartender among friends, so it was natural for him to mix up some hot toddies--honey, lemon, whiskey, and hot water--warming and tasty!</p>

<p>As artists, their home explodes with creativity and hand-drawn romantic memories. A "Year Uno" card sits on display in their unique hand-crafted cabinet (by <a href="http://www.gundersonfurnishings.com/">Gunderson Furnishings</a>) in their living room. </p>

<p>Grace + Jeff share a love for good music, particularly picking out records from Jeff's collection to listen to together.<br />

<p>Hot toddies + a favorite record = dancing time.<br />

<p>After some records and dancing time, Jeff pulled out his guitar to share some of his own musical talents. Jeff is an incredibly talented guitarist, song-writer, and vocalist. He started to serenade Grace with one of the songs that he recently recorded on his first album. As Grace sat down in the living room to share in some art-creation time with Jeff, she grabbed Jeff's old journal to draw in, which just happened to have Jeff's entry of their trip to Belgium, where he had proposed to Grace. As Grace started to flip the pages to find a clean space to draw on, she found Jeff's handwritten notes of their trip and started to reminisce of their sweet European adventures together. </p>

<p>As Grace sketched Jeff playing guitar and Jeff continued to serenade Grace, they exchanged sweet glances of admiration and love. They were both in their creative elements and soaking in the special moment together. Not forced, not created, just as their relationship is. How special it was for us to be there to capture their lifestyle together. </p>

<p>Need I say more? Just look at Jeff's eyes on Grace!<br />

<p>As Grace finished her drawing of Jeff playing guitar, she flipped back several pages to read more of Jeff's words from their European adventures. Then she turned to his entry of the night he proposed to her. As she read the words out loud, it was like hearing a sweet, anticipated love story come to life. Grace's heart filled with butterflies and joy all over again, and she read how he proposed to her on the streets of Belgium, on their first international trip together.<br />

<p>This special moment culminated in sweet smiles and embraces, as they both lingered over their thoughts of their long future together.<br />
