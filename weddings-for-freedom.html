<p><em>Your wedding supports a good cause.</em></p>
<p>MJP supports <a href="http://www.weddingsforfreedom.com/weddings_for_freedom/home.html">Weddings for Freedom</a> to fight back against modern day slavery. Along with wedding vendors across the country, we annually donate a portion of our proceeds towards rescuing girls and boys from slavery and providing them with a safe haven and resources. A portion of the proceeds from YOUR wedding goes toward supporting this critical cause and has effects wider than we can imagine.</p>
