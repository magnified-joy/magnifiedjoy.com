Our experience with them so far has gone above and beyond every expectation we had. We were so happy when they agreed to travel all the way to our tiny little mountain town to photograph our engagement shoot. They took the time to get to know us and that absolutely shines through our photos. 

I was worried that being separated by hundreds of miles would make doing business with them a bit more difficult. However, Maria and En Tao are always more than willing to chat via Skype, email, or Facebook. They have been super easy to communicate with and so far planning has been a breeze!
