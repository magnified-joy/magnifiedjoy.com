We had the pleasure of working with Magnified Joy for our wedding this summer and I honestly cannot say enough wonderful things about them.  Our entire experience with Maria and En Tao, from start to finish, went above and beyond all of our expectations.   

Not only did every single photo turn out stunningly beautiful, but we couldn't have asked for better people to work with.  Maria and En Tao went the extra mile for us in every sense of the phrase.  From traveling all the way to our remote mountain town in Colorado for our engagement shoot, to providing a spontaneous boudoir shoot just a couple days before the wedding, to filming one of the most precious moments of our wedding day and presenting it to us as a wonderful surprise-- It makes my heart burst with joy just thinking about how special they made our whole wedding experience!  I feel so lucky!

Maria and En Tao have a wonderful way of helping you feel comfortable in front of the camera.  It was easy for my husband and I to be ourselves around them which enabled them to capture those genuine emotions on film.  We wanted our photos to look natural and beautiful and that is exactly how they turned out.  
  
Our wedding day was absolutely perfect and a BIG part of that is because of Magnified Joy.  I am so grateful for the experience we had and will cherish our photos forever.
