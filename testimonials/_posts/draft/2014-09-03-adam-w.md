My wife and I love both the posed pictures with family and the candid photos from the ceremony, reception, and everywhere in between. They didn't miss anything and did a great job of discerning which things were most important to us and taking extra photos of those things. I couldn't be happier with Magnified Joy Photography or the photos from my wedding!
