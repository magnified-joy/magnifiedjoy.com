Neither of us are used to photo shoots, so we were a bit nervous and not really sure what to expect before it. They did a really great job of explaining the whole process, talking (and listening!!) with us to decide where and how we wanted to do our pictures, and most of all, making us feel comfortable with the shoot...Our pictures also turned out beautifully, and we couldn't be happier with the final product. We shot in a variety of locations and settings, and they all turned out great.

We can't recommend Magnified Joy enough!!
