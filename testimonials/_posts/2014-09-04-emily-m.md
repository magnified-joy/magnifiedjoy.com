It's hard to put into a quick few sentences how great Maria and En Tao are. They did an engagement shoot for my fiance and me a couple of months ago. Even though I had never met them, it felt like a couple of old friends just wanted to hear our story and take pictures of us. I would typically so much rather be behind a camera than in front of it, but these two made it comfortable to be natural..even if my natural is still kinda awkward. The pictures are amazing and one of my favorites is being sent out this week as an invitation!
