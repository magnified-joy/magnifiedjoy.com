Magnified Joy Photography shot both our engagement and wedding, and I have to say, the entire process with them was a JOY. 

From the outset they met with us and asked about the look and feel we were going for. This communicative approach and personal catering afforded an aesthetic that we were happy with from the outset. Both our engagement and wedding photos were set in an informal yet classic style, with our ceremony being a non-traditional brunch in a park setting, and memories were captured in a natural and unforced way. For wedding photographers, they have a magical ability to slip into the background to allow the day to feel as natural as possible.

Following the wedding they provided a USB with our edited photos and an online gallery for friends and family to see and purchase personal prints. We are both really happy with the product and the professional yet relaxed service. Within two weeks our photos were in our hands, with one of their photos for our "Thank You" cards for guests. 

As photographers, Maria and En Tao were so professional yet approachable, which made us feel comfortable in front of the camera (even those most camera shy). They took the time to learn the names of our extended family members which helped a smooth and quick transition of lineups for family photos. They were gentle and patient with their instructions. And they made us laugh! 

I would highly highly recommend MJP for your engagement, wedding (and boudoir!) photos. They really know how to treat their clients with respect, and they deliver an absolutely beautiful product that tells your own love story.
