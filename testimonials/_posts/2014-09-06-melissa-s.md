We had the pleasure of working with Maria and En Tao on our engagement shoot in San Francisco. They raised the bar on all of our expectations for the whole experience by being genuinely interested in getting to know us and our story as a couple... Now, I'm not one who is generally very comfortable in front of a camera (read = constant danger of double chin), but both Maria and En Tao were extremely patient and encouraging, and because of their professional and personal support, we were able to snap some really beautiful shots that I am so excited to share with friends and fam (picking gorgeous backdrops in San Francisco definitely helped, too!).

I would definitely recommend Magnified Joy because they are a passionate, creative and caring team who do some amazing work. Extra perks? - Maria and Entao are well connected in the wedding-verse and can connect you with tips and resources for the million other things that go into planning a wedding! Oh, and they travel.
