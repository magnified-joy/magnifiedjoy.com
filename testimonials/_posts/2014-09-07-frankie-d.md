We were able to work with Magnified Joy in a stylized shoot...with a cool fusion between Indian and American cultures. Something that sets Magnified Joy Photography apart is their ability to make every single person feel and look beautiful in their photos. Given that they value the people they are working with, making them feel great is their goal. They are also wonderful communicators and that helps everyone to LOOK great, too! If they were also able to accomplish this on a frigid winter day in Wisconsin, they are able to do anything. I love the photos that they took of us and I can't wait for the next round. Highly recommended!
