Maria and En Tao come highly recommended by all who work with them. We've had the pleasure of shooting our engagement and wedding photos with them, and are overjoyed with the quality of work they've done. They've given us photos to last a lifetime, and then some! What we love most about Magnified Joy Photography is that the focus is not just on producing great photos (that is something they've already mastered), but on capturing life and relationships. They just get it! They also make you feel so comfortable in the process and don't miss a single moment. We couldn't be more pleased that we chose Magnified Joy Photography for our most important day, and can't wait to find new ways to keep working with them!
