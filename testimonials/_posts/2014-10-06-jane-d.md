Working with Magnified Joy was one of the best parts of our wedding. Since we knew early on in our wedding planning that we wanted them as our photographers, we were greatly supported by Maria and En Tao throughout our whole planning process. They have gone above and beyond as our photographers. You can trust in their skill and trust in their diligence, not to mention the many beautiful photos and memories we are proud and excited to share with our family and friends.
