<p>[expand title="Do you have a limit on the number of photos you take on a wedding day? How about the hours of coverage during the day?"]There is NO limit on the amount of photos taken during the day and NO time limit. We want to capture all the spontaneous and precious moments from start to finish, and we don’t want you to have to worry about our schedule, that's why we offer a package with unlimited hours of coverage.[/expand]<br />
<br><br />
[expand title="Will you travel to _______ ?"]The answer is yes! Do not let distance deter you from considering us. All of our wedding packages include travel in the US. It does not matter if it’s Florida or Alaska or anywhere in between, the price is the same! For international and destination weddings, please contact us and we can create a custom package for you.[/expand]<br />
<br><br />
[expand title="How do we arrange your travel to our wedding?"]Don’t worry, we arrange our own travel and accommodation. Just tell us the date and location and we’ll be there. [/expand]<br />
<br><br />
[expand title="Pricing"]Please contact us for full details.<br/><br />
We also arrange a la carte packages for non-traditional weddings, shorter time frames, and international events. Contact us with your ideas and we will work with you to customize as you need.</p>
<p><strong>A Note about Payment</strong><br />
A retainer is due when you return your signed contract. Your wedding date is secured when we have received this retainer and signed contract. We prefer checks, but a credit card option is also available.[/expand]<br />
<br><br />
[expand title="How do we book and pay?"]A retainer is due when you return the signed contract back to us. Your date is not secured until we have received a retainer and a signed contract. We prefer checks, but a credit card option is also available.[/expand]<br />
<br><br />
[expand title="How many photos do we get?"]We typically deliver between 400-600 images. You will receive all digital negatives with no watermarks.[/expand]<br />
<br><br />
[expand title="Approximately how long do we have to wait to get our photos back?"]Photos are typically ready within two weeks of the wedding date. Albums are ready approximately 1-4 weeks after you approve the design.[/expand]<br />
<br><br />
[expand title="Are all of our photos edited?"]All of the photos we deliver are edited to our perfection.[/expand]<br />
<br><br />
[expand title="Do you provide a print and distribution release?"]Yes! We provide a print and distribution release with all of our packages. You are free to print as many or as little images as you like from any vendor that you like. You are also free to distribute your images online (facebook, twitter, email, etc). We just kindly ask that you provide photo credit. We also offer prints from our professional print lab if you want it done to our perfection.[/expand]<br />
<br><br />
[expand title="What format do the photos come in?"]You will receive a high resolution version of your images on an engraved wooden USB for printing and sharing as you wish. You will also have access to an online gallery which you can share with your friends and family.[/expand]<br />
<br><br />
[expand title="Do you do any printing yourselves?"]Yes we do. We print on many mediums including wood, metal, canvas, burlap, bamboo, as well as glossy and matte prints...the sky is the limit! We can discuss all this at your consultation. [/expand]<br />
<br><br />
[expand title="Do you have insurance?"]Absolutely. Please let us know if your venue requires it from us.[/expand]<br />
<br><br />
[expand title="Do you do other types of photography besides weddings?"]Right now we specialize in engagements, weddings, and boudoir. If you are interested in having us photograph any other occasion, please contact us and we will consider it on a case by case basis.[/expand]<br />
<br><br />
[expand title="My fiancé is uncomfortable having his photo taken. HELP!"]Never fear! That’s why we offer a complimentary engagement shoot. This helps us all get to know each other and help you two feel more comfortable in front of the camera. That way when we get to your wedding day, you’ll already connect with the camera, connect with each other in front of the camera, and connect with us. You aren’t jumping into awkward, posed photos. We can become an extension of your friends and family who are celebrating along with you.[/expand]<br />
