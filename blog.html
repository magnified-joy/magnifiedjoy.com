            <p>My brother was the one growing up who repeatedly ordered his burgers “just plain.”</p>

<p>–“Ketchup, mustard, pickles, lettuce, onion, cheese?”</p><p>

–“Just plain. Meat and bun. Thank you.”</p><p>

It’s hard to believe this same boy is now one of my foodie inspirations, as he creates some of the most unique, wholesome, and tasty food that I know. His eagerness to learn, his creativity, and his humble nature to impress no-one, has also rightfully earned him a page in this month’s Madison Magazine, representing one of Madison’s best restaurants, Forequarter. His ingenuity and food skills extend far beyond his restaurant duties though. Ben Blohoweak has led the way in carrying on one of our food traditions growing up in Green Bay–booyah–and carried that passion to share it with others in Madison, where we both now reside.</p><p>

I was surprised when I started asking my Madisonian friends if they’ve ever heard of booyah, only to respond, “BOOYAH!” with a verbal punch. I said, “Yes, you’re right, but have you ever tried the food?” With a confused look on their face I began to understand that my friends only knew of booyah as a verbal exclamation rather than the rich tradition of the amazing chicken stew that I was referring to. I had assumed that booyah was an Upper Midwestern tradition! I began finding out that only people north of the Fox Cities, in the counties of Brown, Outagamie, etc. really knew what I was referring to! I started to do some research, and along with a well-written article by Terese Allen, I now understand that booyah was very much a smaller regional cuisine that I thought.
</p><p>
In light of that, I was so happy that my brother was going to capitalize on this idea and actually bring booyah to Madison! Not that he was trying to make any money at all, but rather, simply wanting to share the love of this Belgian tradition of ours with friends, Ben set off to make a BIG ‘ol batch of booyah.
