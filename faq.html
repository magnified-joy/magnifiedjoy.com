<h2 style="margin-top:0px"><span class="anchor"><a name="2"></a>1.</span>Will you travel to _______ ?</h2>
<p>The answer is yes! Do not let distance deter you from considering us. All of our wedding packages include travel in the US. It does not matter if it’s Florida or Alaska or anywhere in between, the price is the same! For international and destination weddings, please contact us and we can create a custom package for you.</p>
<hr>
<h2><span class="anchor"><a name="3"></a>2.</span>How do we arrange your travel to our wedding?</h2>
<p>Don’t worry, we arrange our own travel and accommodation. Just tell us the date and location and we’ll be there.</p>
<hr>

<h2><span class="anchor"><a name="5"></a>3.</span>How do we book and pay?</h2>
<p>A retainer is due when you return the signed contract back to us. Your date is not secured until we have received a retainer and a signed contract. We prefer checks, but a credit card option is also available.</p>
<p>Packages start at $2500, please contact us for full details.</p>
<p>We also arrange a la carte packages for non-traditional weddings, shorter time frames, and international events. Contact us with your ideas and we will work with you to customize as you need.</p>
<h3>A Note about Payment</h3>
<p>A retainer is due when you return your signed contract. Your wedding date is secured when we have received this retainer and signed contract. We prefer checks, but a credit card option is also available.</p>
<hr>

<h2><span class="anchor"><a name="6"></a>4.</span>How many photos do we get?</h2>
<p>We typically deliver between 400-600 images. You will receive all digital negatives with no watermarks.</p>
<hr>

<h2><span class="anchor"><a name="7"></a>5.</span>Approximately how long do we have to wait to get our photos back?</h2>
<p>Photos are typically ready within two weeks of the wedding date. Albums are ready approximately 1-4 weeks after you approve the design.</p>
<hr>

<h2><span class="anchor"><a name="8"></a>6.</span>Are all of our photos edited?</h2>
<p>All of the photos we deliver are edited to our perfection.</p>
<hr>

<h2><span class="anchor"><a name="9"></a>7.</span>Do you provide a print and distribution release?</h2>
<p>Yes! We provide a print and distribution release with all of our packages. You are free to print as many or as little images as you like from any vendor that you like. You are also free to distribute your images online (facebook, twitter, email, etc). We just kindly ask that you provide photo credit. We also offer prints from our professional print lab if you want it done to our perfection.</p>

<hr>
<h2><span class="anchor"><a name="10"></a>8.</span>What format do the photos come in?</h2>
<p>You will receive a high resolution version of your images on an engraved wooden USB for printing and sharing as you wish. You will also have access to an online gallery which you can share with your friends and family.</p>
<hr>

<h2><span class="anchor"><a name="11"></a>9.</span>Do you do any printing yourselves?</h2>
<p>Yes we do. We print on many mediums including wood, metal, canvas, burlap, bamboo, as well as glossy and matte prints…the sky is the limit! We can discuss all this at your consultation.</p>
<hr>

<h2><span class="anchor"><a name="12"></a>10.</span>Do you have insurance?</h2>
<p>Absolutely. Please let us know if your venue requires it from us.</p>
<hr>

<h2><span class="anchor"><a name="13"></a>11.</span>Do you do other types of photography besides weddings?</h2>
<p>Right now we specialize in engagements, weddings, and boudoir. If you are interested in having us photograph any other occasion, please contact us and we will consider it on a case by case basis.</p>
<hr>

<h2><span class="anchor"><a name="14"></a>12.</span>My fiancé is uncomfortable having his photo taken. HELP!</h2>
<p>Never fear! That’s why we offer a complimentary engagement shoot. This helps us all get to know each other and help you two feel more comfortable in front of the camera. That way when we get to your wedding day, you’ll already connect with the camera, connect with each other in front of the camera, and connect with us. You aren’t jumping into awkward, posed photos. We can become an extension of your friends and family who are celebrating along with you.</p>
