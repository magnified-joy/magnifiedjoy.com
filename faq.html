<p>There is NO limit on the amount of photos taken during the day and NO time limit. We want to capture all the spontaneous and precious moments from start to finish, and we don’t want you to have to worry about our schedule, that’s why we offer a package with unlimited hours of coverage.</p>

<hr>

<h2><span class="anchor"><a name="14"></a>14.</span>My fiancé is uncomfortable having his photo taken. HELP!</h2>
<p>Never fear! That’s why we offer a complimentary engagement shoot. This helps us all get to know each other and help you two feel more comfortable in front of the camera. That way when we get to your wedding day, you’ll already connect with the camera, connect with each other in front of the camera, and connect with us. You aren’t jumping into awkward, posed photos. We can become an extension of your friends and family who are celebrating along with you.</p>
