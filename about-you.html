    <h2>We are where you are</h2><p>
As a husband and wife team, we love working with couples, and we have extensive experience working in multicultural settings and with multi-racial couples – after all, we are one! We have shot several multicultural weddings. We have even done an international wedding in Hong Kong for a French bride and a Chinese groom, with a non-English ceremony.</p><p>

We don’t have one set home base. And yes, we travel anywhere! We have done weddings across the United States, in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Colorado, California, and even as far as China. <strong><em>Wherever you are in the world, we can come to you!</em></strong> Our rates include travel to your wedding <em>anywhere in the US</em> so there will be no extra expenses for you, and we can create a custom quote for weddings abroad.</p>
