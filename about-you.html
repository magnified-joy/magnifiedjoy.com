    <h2>Are we right for you?</h2>
    <p>
    <ul><li>
    If you want “organic” approach, true to nature, and true to yourselves. Primarily using natural light and always drawing out your natural beauty in every shot. 
</li><li>If you value a quality client experience. We love our clients and give them the highest attention and care, from initial consultation to future sessions.
</li><li>If you seek high-quality, eco-friendly, and artisan products--from sustainably harvested wood and bamboo prints to heirloom linen or leather albums, to beautifully crafted wood boxes to beautifully and safely store your albums and more.
</li><li>If you desire to be encouraged in your marriage, rather than just planning for your wedding day.
</li><li>If you desire a holistic, personal experience from photographers who get to know your wedding party and family and your individual personalities.
</li><li>If you value art and creativity, and you trust your photographers to bring that to your love story.</li></ul>

    <h2>We are where you are</h2><p>
As a husband and wife team, we love working with couples, and we have extensive experience working in multicultural settings and with multi-racial couples – after all, we are one! We have phhotographed several multicultural weddings. We have even photographed an international wedding in Hong Kong for a French bride and a Chinese groom, with a non-English ceremony.</p><p>

We don’t have one set home base. And yes, we travel anywhere! We have photographed weddings and engagements across the United States, in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Wisconsin, Minnestoa, Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Texas and Colorado, just to name a few. We photographed a wedding as far as China! <strong><em>Wherever you are in the world, we can come to you!</em></strong> Our rates include travel to your wedding <em>anywhere in the US</em> so there will be no extra expenses for you, and we can create a custom quote for weddings abroad.</p>
