        <h1>A Traveling Team</h1>
        <p>We are not your average wedding photographers. We are a traveling husband and wife team that care as much about your marriage as the quality of your photography experience on your wedding day.</p>

<p>We take an organic approach to wedding and engagement photography. We take the initiative to make sure your day will flow as smoothly as possible with ongoing communication throughout your engagement as well as getting together to plan and discuss your wedding day timeline several weeks before your wedding. When your wedding day arrives, you will feel confident about our approach, as we naturally and sincerely interact with you and your guests. We take great joy in getting to build relationships with every one of our clients, and their families and friends, and consider it a huge privilege to be entrusted to photograph one of the greatest days of your lives. For us, Magnified Joy Photography is far more than just shooting a wedding. It’s an organic experience. It’s curated quality artisan products. But most of all, it’s relationships.</p>

        <h3>Together, <a href="#">Maria and En Tao</a> make up Magnified Joy Photography.</h3>
As a husband and wife team, we love working with couples, and we have extensive experience working in multicultural settings and with multi-racial couples &#8211; after all, we are one! We have shot several multicultural weddings. We have even done an international wedding in Hong Kong for a French bride and a Chinese groom, with a non-English ceremony.</p>


        
        <h2>International Wedding Photographers for Young Adventure Seekers</h2>

<p>We don’t have one set home base. And yes, we travel anywhere! We have done weddings across the United States, in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Colorado, California, and even as far as China. Wherever you are in the world, we can come to you! Our rates include travel to your wedding anywhere in the US so there will be no extra expenses for you, and we can create a custom quote for weddings abroad. </p>
